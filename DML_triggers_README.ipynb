        "# Database Trigger Project Readme\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on the implementation of database triggers using PostgreSQL. Triggers are database objects that are automatically executed in response to specific events on a particular table or view. The triggers created in this project are designed to capture and log changes in an employee database, including new entries, salary updates, and general table changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Table Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`employees` Table:**\n",
        "   - Columns:\n",
        "     - `id`: Unique identifier for each employee.\n",
        "     - `first_name`: First name of the employee.\n",
        "     - `last_name`: Last name of the employee.\n",
        "     - `department`: Department in which the employee works.\n",
        "     - `salary`: Salary of the employee.\n",
        "   - Primary Key: `id`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`new_employee_logs` Table:**\n",
        "   - Columns:\n",
        "     - `first_name`: First name of the new employee.\n",
        "     - `last_name`: Last name of the new employee.\n",
        "     - `joining_date`: Date when the employee joined.\n",
        "   - Records new entries in the `employees` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`employee_salary_logs` Table:**\n",
        "   - Columns:\n",
        "     - `id`: Unique identifier for each salary log entry.\n",
        "     - `first_name`: First name of the employee.\n",
        "     - `last_name`: Last name of the employee.\n",
        "     - `old_salary`: Previous salary of the employee.\n",
        "     - `incremented_salary`: New salary after an update.\n",
        "     - `incremented_on`: Date when the salary was incremented.\n",
        "   - Records changes in the salary of employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`table_changed_logs` Table:**\n",
        "   - Columns:\n",
        "     - `change_type`: Type of change (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",
        "     - `changed_table_name`: Name of the table that was changed.\n",
        "     - `changed_on`: Date when the change occurred.\n",
        "   - Records all changes (INSERT, UPDATE) in monitored tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Implemented Triggers\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **New Employee Trigger (`new_employee_joining_func`):**\n",
        "   - Triggered after inserting a new entry into the `employees` table.\n",
        "   - Captures the first name, last name, and joining date.\n",
        "   - Logs the entry in the `new_employee_logs` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Employee Salary Update Trigger (`employee_salary_update_func`):**\n",
        "   - Triggered after updating the salary in the `employees` table.\n",
        "   - Audits changes in the salary, including old salary, new salary, and the date of change.\n",
        "   - Logs the entry in the `employee_salary_logs` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Table Change Logs Trigger (`table_changed_logs_func`):**\n",
        "   - Triggered after INSERT or UPDATE on the `employees` table.\n",
        "   - Logs the type of change, the table name, and the date of change.\n",
        "   - Logs entries in the `table_changed_logs` table.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Setting Up the Database:**\n",
        "   - Execute the SQL statements provided to create the required tables (`employees`, `new_employee_logs`, `employee_salary_logs`, `table_changed_logs`).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Creating Triggers:**\n",
        "   - Run the SQL statements for creating triggers (`new_employee_joining_func`, `employee_salary_update_func`, `table_changed_logs_func`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inserting Data:**\n",
        "   - Insert data into the `employees` table to observe trigger actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Viewing Logs:**\n",
        "   - Use SELECT statements on related tables (`new_employee_logs`, `employee_salary_logs`, `table_changed_logs`) to view captured logs.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dropping Triggers:**\n",
        "   - Optionally, use the provided SQL statements to drop triggers if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Queries\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Insert New Employee:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department, salary)\n",
        "   VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Engineering', 90000);\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Update Employee Salary:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   UPDATE employees\n",
        "   SET salary = 95000\n",
        "   WHERE last_name = 'Doe';\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **View New Employee Logs:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   SELECT * FROM new_employee_logs;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **View Salary Change Logs:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   SELECT * FROM employee_salary_logs;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **View Table Change Logs:**\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   SELECT * FROM table_changed_logs;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important Notes\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ensure that the triggers are enabled and in place before making changes to the `employees` table to capture events accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use caution when dropping triggers, as it may impact the logging functionality.\n",
